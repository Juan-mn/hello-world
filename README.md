# hello-world
A test repository for the hello-world guide.

This is a project just to get started with GitHub, so that's why it's called `hello-world`. See more at https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/.

My name's Juan M.N. (the 'wan' at Padawan and 'Man' on my username), and I'm 16. I started to become interested in programming at the age of 12 and I have already some experience, but I'm relatively new to community programming and willing to start now.
